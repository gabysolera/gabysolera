## Hi there!

I’m a Project Manager & Program Lead who works across software, data, and ML projects, blending Agile, Lean, and pragmatic delivery methods for fast-growing tech teams. Outside of tech, I’m a dancer and an political science enthousiast that keep me grounded, curious, and creatively driven in everything I build.

**What I do**

Lead end-to-end software onboarding projects

Build PMO frameworks, governance frameworks, and execution systems

Improve team efficiency with Jira workflows and automation


**What you’ll find here**

I use GitHub to document how I work as a PM:

Project management templates & frameworks

Case studies based on real delivery challenges (no confidential data)

AI prompts & tools for project management

Notes and technical learning to better support engineering teams

**Currently learning**

Advanced PMO strategy, technical architecture fundamentals, International Relations theory, and some arabic!

**Connect**

I´m happy to connect and share ideas about project management, delivery systems, and PMO design.
